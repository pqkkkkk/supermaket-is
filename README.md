## ðŸš€ Overview
In this project, We analyzed business requirements of a supermarket and designed a database to manage its operations. Especially, we focused on analyzing possible concurrency conflicts when this system is used by multiple users simultaneously. From this analysis, we proposed solutions to avoid these conflicts by using MS SQL Server features such as transactions, locks, and isolation levels.
